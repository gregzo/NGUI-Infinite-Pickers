NGUI Infinite Pickers
=====================

A little framework for creating pickers with NGUI.

Initial commit : v1.53

Last known compatible NGUI version : v3.5

This project was initially sold on the Unity Asset Store. I will not be maintaining it anymore, feel free to fork!

<b>How to update</b>
<br>
Just like with NGUI, first create a new scene, then delete the NGUIPickers folder from the project view, then import NGUI Infinite Pickers from the asset store.

<b>Note to UnityScript users</b> 
<br>
NGUIPickers/Scripts should be moved to the Plugins folder.

<b>Support</b>
